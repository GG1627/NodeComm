- **Compensation**: 15% Applied (shows retimer working)
- **Link Distance**: 2.5m Extended (shows signal reach)
- **Error Rate**: 0.01% (shows signal integrity)

#### **2. Smart Cable Module (Taurus Intelligent Cable)**

- **Bandwidth Usage**: 85 GB/s (real-time monitoring)
- **Cable Health**: Excellent/Thermal Stress/Failed
- **Thermal Status**: Normal/Warning/Critical
- **Link Monitoring**: Active (shows smart monitoring)

#### **3. CXL Memory Controller (Leo Memory Platform)**

- **Memory Pools**: 3 Active (shows pooling capability)
- **Channel Usage**: 45% (shows CXL utilization)
- **Pool Access**: 64GB Available (shows memory expansion)

## ðŸŽ­ **Backend - Astera-Specific Metrics**

### **New KPI Metrics Added:**

1. **Signal Integrity Score** (0-100%): Overall connection quality
2. **Retimer Compensation Level** (0-100%): How much signal cleanup needed
3. **Smart Cable Health** (0-100%): Thermal and bandwidth stress monitoring
4. **CXL Channel Utilization** (0-100%): Memory traffic distribution

### **Realistic Calculations:**

- **Signal quality** degrades with latency, utilization, and errors
- **Retimer compensation** increases with distance and signal issues
- **Smart cable health** decreases with thermal stress and high bandwidth
- **CXL utilization** tracks memory pool traffic distribution
